Resolving dependencies...
flutter : Because bloc_test ^9.1.1 depends on 
bloc ^8.1.1 and frontend depends on bloc 
^9.1.0, bloc_test ^9.1.1 is forbidden.
At line:1 char:14
+ ... d frontend; flutter test 
test/auth_bloc_test.dart > test_results.txt

So, because frontend depends on bloc_test 
^9.1.7, version solving failed.


You can try the following suggestion to make 
the pubspec resolve:
* Try upgrading your constraint on bloc_test: 
flutter pub add dev:bloc_test:^10.0.0
